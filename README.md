HTML: 
Stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page 
creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML 
elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes. 
HTML has a lot of use cases, namely: 
Web development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web 
page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. 
Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and 
websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. 
Web documentation. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly 
to Microsoft Word. 
It also worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language as it can’t create 
dynamic functionality. It is now considered an official web standard. The World Wide Web 
Consortium (W3C) maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular 
updates 
The average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance, a home page, an about 
page, and a contact page would all have separate HTML files. 
HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. A web browser reads the 
HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it. 
All HTML pages have a series of HTML elements, consisting of a set of tags and attributes. HTML 
elements are the building blocks of a web page. A tag tells the web browser where an element 
begins and ends, whereas an attribute describes the characteristics of an element. 
The three main parts of an element are: 
Opening tag – used to state where an element starts to take effect. The tag is wrapped with 
opening and closing angle brackets. For example, use the start tag <p> to create a 
paragraph. 
Content – this is the output that other users see. 
Closing tag – the same as the opening tag, but with a forward slash before the element 
name. For example, </p> to end a paragraph. 
Most Used HTML Tags and HTML Elements 
Currently, there are 142 HTML tags available that allow for the creation of various elements. Even 
though modern browsers no longer support some of these tags, learning all the different elements 
available is still beneficial. 
This section will discuss the most-used HTML tags and two main elements – block-level elements 
and inline elements. 

Block-Level Elements 
A block-level element takes up the entire width of a page. It always starts a new line in the 
document. For example, a heading element will be in a separate line from a paragraph element. 

Every HTML page uses these three tags: 
<html> tag is the root element that defines the whole HTML document. 
<head> tag holds meta information such as the page’s title and charset. 
<body> tag encloses all the content that appears on the page. 
<html> 
<head> 
<!-- META INFORMATION --> 
</head> 
<body> 
<!-- PAGE CONTENT --> 
</body> 
</html> 

Other popular block-level tags include: 
 Heading tags – these range from <h1> to <h6>, where heading h1 is largest in size, getting 
smaller as they move up to h6. 
 Paragraph tags – are all enclosed by using the <p> tag. 
 List tags – have different variations. Use the <ol> tag for an ordered list, and use <ul> for 
an unordered list. Then, enclose individual list items using the <li> tag. 

Inline Elements 
An inline element formats the inner content of block-level elements, such as adding links and 
emphasized strings. Inline elements are most commonly used to format text without breaking the 
flow of the content. 
For example, a <strong> tag would render an element in bold, whereas the <em> tag would show it 
in italics. Hyperlinks are also inline elements that use an <a> tag and an href attribute to indicate 
the link’s destination: 
<a href="https://example.com/">Click me!</a> 
HTML Evolution – What Differs Between HTML and HTML5? 
The first version of HTML consisted of 18 tags. Since then, each new version came with new tags 
and attributes added to the markup. The most significant upgrade of the language so far was the 
introduction of HTML5 in 2014. 
The main difference between HTML and HTML5 is that HTML5 supports new kinds of form 
controls. HTML5 also introduced several semantic tags that clearly describe the content, such as 
<article>, <header>, and <footer>. 

Cascading Style Sheets 
CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages 
presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to 
do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. It describes how a webpage 
should look: it prescribes colors, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your 
website look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, 
including how elements are positioned in the browser. 

Internal, External and Inline CSS Styles 
We’ll go over each style briefly, for an in-depth explanation of each method, there will be a link 
below the overview. Let’s start by talking about the Internal style. CSS styles done this way are 
loaded each time a website is refreshed, which may increase loading time. Additionally, you won’t 
be able to use the same CSS style on multiple pages as it’s contained within a single page. 
However, this also comes with benefits. Having everything on one page makes it easier to share 
the template for a preview. 
The External method might be the most convenient one. Everything is done externally on a .css 
file. This means you can do all the styling on a separate file and apply the CSS to any page you 
want. The External style might also improve loading times. 
Lastly, we will talk about the Inline style of CSS. Inline works with specific elements that have the 
<style> tag. Each component has to be stylized, so it might not be the best or fastest way to handle 
CSS. But it can come in handy. For example, if you want to change a single element, quickly 
preview changes, or maybe you don’t have access to the CSS files. 

External CSS: 
External CSS contains separate CSS file which contains only style property with the help 
of tag attributes (For example class, id, heading, … etc). CSS property written in a separate file 
with .css extension and should be linked to the HTML document using link tag. This means that for 
each element, style can be set only once and that will be applied across web pages. 
The AL-FAROOQ hospital, an institution that is built, staffed, and equipped for the diagnosis of 
disease; for the treatment, both medical and surgical, of the sick and the injured; and for their 
housing during this process. The modern hospital also often serves as a centre for investigation 
and for teaching. 
To better serve the wide-ranging needs of the community, the modern hospital has often 
developed outpatient facilities, as well as emergency, psychiatric, and rehabilitation services. In 
addition, “bed less hospitals” provide strictly ambulatory (outpatient) care and day surgery. 
Patients arrive at the facility for short appointments. They may also stay for treatment in surgical 
or medical units for part of a day or for a full day, after which they are discharged for follow-up 
by a primary care health provider. 
Hospitals have long existed in most countries. Developing countries, which contain a large 
proportion of the world’s population, generally do not have enough hospitals, equipment, and 
trained staff to handle the volume of persons who need care. Thus, people in these countries do 
not always receive the benefits of modern medicine, public health measures, or hospital care, and 
they generally have lower life expectancies. 
This project will help people to get appoints form home in case emergency.it will be also for help 
for people by checking online which treatments are available here.
